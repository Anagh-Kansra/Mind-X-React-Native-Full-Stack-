# Mind X Insight Sharing App

## Overview

The **Mind X Insight Sharing App** is a mobile application built using React Native and Expo for the front-end, and Node.js with Express.js for the back-end. The app enables users to share insightful posts with a title, description, image, and relevant links, fostering a community of knowledge sharing. It incorporates user authentication, post creation, and a dynamic home feed displaying shared insights. The back-end is hosted on Render, with a MongoDB database to store user and post data, and Cloudinary is used for image storage.
